# GAN
## Description:
> All GAN models present here have been taken either from the book by Rowel Atienza "Advanced Deep Learning with Keras" or various web sources on Advanced GAN Models 

## Models Added:
- gan                            - Builder Script for Higher Models
- Vanilla GAN                    - Simple Convolutional GAN for mnist Data
- Deep Convolutional GAN         - Deep Convolutional GAN
- Wasserstein GAN                - Higher GAN which uses Wasserstein Loss Function
- Conditional GAN                - Conditional GAN's where you can give an additional input of label and get the desired result
- Least Squares GAN               - Higher GAN, more stable, Uses MSE loss
- Info GAN                        - Disentagled GAN,used to differentiate and generate between features in the generated images
- Stacked GAN                     - Hybridized Disentangled GAN,uses Enocders to build features that are used for generation
- Auxiliary Conditional GAN       - Auxiliary Conditional GAN, same as cgan with I/O different
- Pix2Pix                         - Instance Based Cycle GAN, used for conditioning Noise(or other images) onto Specific Images

#### More Models will be added soon!!!
