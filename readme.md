# GAN
## Description:
> All GAN models present here have been taken either from the book by Rowel Atienza "Advanced Deep Learning with Keras" or various web sources on Advanced GAN Models 

## Models Added:
- gan         - Builder Script for Higher Models
- vanilla_gan - Simple Convolutional GAN for mnist Data
- dcgan       - Deep Convolutional GAN
- wgan        - Higher GAN which uses Wasserstein Loss Function
- cgan        - Conditional GAN's where you can give an additional input of label and get the desired result
- lsgan       - Higher GAN, more stable, Uses MSE loss
- infogan     - Disentagled GAN,used to differentiate and generate between features in the generated images
- stackedgan  - Hybridized Disentangled GAN,uses Enocders to build features that are used for generation
- acgan       - Auxiliary Conditional GAN, same as cgan with I/O different
- pix2pix     - Instance Based Cycle GAN, used for conditioning Noise(or other images) onto Specific Images

#### More Models will be added soon!!!
